#Unmasker#

This is a simple little app that I built back in 2009 to have a bit of fun with text-replacement and people's twitter bios.

For the full grisly tale see [this post](http://www.webdeveloper2.com/2009/07/unmasker-chronicles-dawn-of-the-demon/)

I'm dropping this in here in case anybody wants to have a look at it or make it work again (assuming that the latest Twitter API will allow it).
